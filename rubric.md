* The main layout uses grid areas as instructed and looks reasonably similar to the [example](screen_captures/full-size-styled-sm.png).

* One media query has been added at the bottom of *main.css* as instructed under the heading "Part 3: Responsive web design" in the [README](README.md).

* The layout resulting from the media query uses grid areas as instructed and *at a narrow width* looks reasonably similar to the [example](screen_captures/phone-size-styled-sm.png).

## 15 points:

All of the above. Plus:

1. Two different Google fonts are visible and affect all text on the page when connected to the Internet.

2. The font stacks comply with best practices as explained by Robbins and exactly as specified in the assignment. This includes correct use of generics.

3. When I gradually resize my browser to a narrow width:

    * The layout changes BEFORE any text paragraphs look too skinny and weird.
    * The top image (typography_line_terms.svg) disappears.
    * The padding is not excessively large anywhere.
    * There are no skinny stripes of a random color at the top or bottom, or in between the elements.

4. When I use the Chrome Developer Tools, and "Toggle Device Toolbar," and choose "iPhone 6/7/8," your *index.html* at github.io looks like the [small-screen example](screen_captures/phone-size-styled-sm.png). (Your fonts will be different, of course.)

5. Your media query does not contain unnecessary selectors, rules or properties.

6. Your media query uses a suitable breakpoint number.

7. The CSS and HTML are formatted neatly, with sensible indents and use of linespaces that make code easy to read.

(All criteria must be met to get 15 points.)

## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or **risk a failing grade for the entire course.** Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
