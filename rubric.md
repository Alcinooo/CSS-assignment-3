## DISHONESTY

Showing your code to any other student, or giving another student code to solve the problem, or any part of the problem, is a violation of the university's honor code. Asking for a solution in any online forum is a violation of the university's honor code. Copying code from another student, past or present, is a violation of the university's honor code. Allowing anyone else to write code for you is a violation of the university's honor code. You must do your own work, or risk a failing grade for the entire course. Penalties for academic dishonesty are spelled out in the syllabus for this course.
